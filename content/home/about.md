# Biography
I am a Ph.D student in the Personal Health Informatics program, an interdiscplinary program at Northeastern University, affiliated with College of Computer and Information Science and Bouve College of Health Sciences. I am also a member of the mHealth research group led by Prof. Stephen Intille.

My research interest lies on building and validating people-facing technological solutions for health using a multidiscplinary approach. So far, my work has focused on (i) ubiquitous sensing via wearable sensors (e.g.: smartwatch, smartphone, and accelerometers), (ii) data-driven and common-sense driven machine learning for modeling physical behavior, (iii) human-computer interfaces for user-in-the-loop machine learning, and (iv) behavior change theory for just-in-time adaptive intervention.

I have academic, industry and clinical experience where I was fortunate to have worked with Profs.
