# Biography
I am a Ph.D student in the Personal Health Informatics program, an interdiscplinary program at Northeastern University, affiliated with College of Computer and Information Science and Bouve College of Health Sciences. I am also a member of the [mHealth research group](https://www.mhealthgroup.org/) led by [Prof. Stephen Intille](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/intille/#_ga=2.72099792.2129103984.1537741596-1858910269.1497104399).

My research interest lies on building and validating people-facing technological solutions for health using a multidiscplinary approach. So far, my work has focused on (i) ubiquitous sensing via wearable sensors (e.g.: smartwatch, smartphone, and accelerometers), (ii) data-driven and common-sense driven machine learning for modeling physical behavior, (iii) human-computer interfaces for user-in-the-loop machine learning, and (iv) behavior change theory for just-in-time adaptive intervention.

I have academic, industry and clinical experience where I was fortunate to have worked with [Hanli Liu (UTA)](https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/hanli-liu), [Gopinath Kaundinya (UTSW)](http://www.corelabs.emory.edu/csi/about_us/bios/kaundinya_gopinath.html), [Christine DeLorenzo (SBU)](https://medicine.stonybrookmedicine.edu/psychiatry/faculty/delorenzo_c), [Todd Ogden (Columbia)](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/to166), [John Mann (Columbia)](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/about/people/j-john-mann-md), [Shiv Hiremath (Temple)](https://cph.temple.edu/pt/faculty/shivayogi-v-hiremath), [Dinesh John (NEU)](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/dinesh-john/), Junzi Dong (Philips Reseach NA).
