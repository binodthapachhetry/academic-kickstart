abstract = "White matter abnormalities are implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). As omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are low in MDD and affect myelination, we hypothesized that PUFA
supplementation may alleviate depression through improving white matter integrity. Acutely depressed
MDD patients (n=16) and healthy volunteers (HV, n=12) had 25-direction diffusion tensor imaging
before and after 6 weeks of fish oil supplementation. Plasma phospholipid omega-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and omega-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) levels
were determined before and after supplementation using high-throughput extraction and gas chromatography
and expressed as a percentage of total phospholipids (PUFA%). Fractional anisotropy (FA)
was computed using a least-squares-fit diffusion tensor with non-linear optimization. Regression analyses
were performed with changes in PUFA levels or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores as predictors,
voxel-wise difference maps of FA as outcome, covariates age and sex, with family-wise correction
for multiple comparisons. Increases in plasma phospholipid DHA% (but not EPA% or AA%) after fish oil
predicted increases in FA in MDD but not HV, in a cluster including genu and body of the corpus callosum,
and anterior corona radiata and cingulum (cluster-level p < 0.001, peak t-score = 8.10, p = 0.002).
There was a trend for greater change in FA in MDD responders over nonresponders (t Â¼ 1.874,
df = 13.56, p = 0.08). Decreased depression severity predicted increased FA in left corticospinal tract and superior longitudinal fasciculus (cluster-level p < 0.001, peak t-score = 5.04, p = 0.0001). Increased FA correlated with increased DHA% and decreased depression severity after fish oil supplementation suggests therapeutic effects of omega-3 PUFAs may be related to improvements in white matter integrity."
